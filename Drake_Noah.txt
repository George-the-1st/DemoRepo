My name is Noah Drake, and I am a senior computer science student at 
College of Charleston. I was born on October 11, 1998 in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, and my lifelong passions include history, technology, 
and gaming. After school, I would love to develop software for a living, 
and in the future, I may try to teach!
