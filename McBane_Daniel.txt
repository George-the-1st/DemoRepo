As you should be able to tell from the file name,
my name is Daniel McBane.

I am going into my senior year here at CofC.

I don't live on campus; I live about an hour's
drive away with my parents.

I have a cat.

I usually spend my spare time reading books,
usually Sci-Fi and Fantasy, or playing video
games, usually some sort of strategy game.

I'm currently working at East Bay Deli to help
pay for school.

I'm not sure what else to say. I wouldn't
consider myself the most interesting person.

But some people might disagree.
